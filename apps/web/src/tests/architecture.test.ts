// @nodal-agents/web — architecture invariant tests.
//
// This package had NO architecture test. That gap is how a personal agent slug
// reached shipped source: the guard existed in 15 packages and this was not one
// of them, so nothing looked at it. Wiring it up is the point of
// @nodal-agents/test-kit — one scanner, every package, no local copies to drift.
